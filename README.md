# 📊 Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project showcases the application of various unsupervised machine learning techniques using real-world datasets. It is structured across three major areas: **Correspondence Analysis**, **Factor Analysis and PCA**, and **Clustering Techniques**. Each approach aims to uncover patterns, reduce dimensionality, or segment data in meaningful ways.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 1. Correspondence Analysis (Simple and Multiple)
**Overview:**
- Performed simple and multiple correspondence analysis on categorical data.
- Extracted perceptual maps to explore associations between profiles and categorical variables.
- Employed chi-square-based interpretation and clustering on reduced dimensions.

---

### 2. Factor Analysis and PCA
**Overview:**
- Applied Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify latent variables in economic and educational data.
- Conducted Bartlett’s and KMO tests for data adequacy.
- Reduced dimensionality using PCA with varimax rotation for interpretability.

---

### 3. Clustering Techniques
**Overview:**
- Implemented Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means.
- Used silhouette scores to determine optimal cluster counts.
- Visualized clusters via 2D/3D scatterplots and evaluated separation with ANOVA.
- Focused on behavioral, regional, and consumer segmentation.
